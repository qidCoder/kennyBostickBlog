            <h2>Trip to Attu, Alaska</h2>
            <p>Arrived at the Island and headed to my private room at the back of the bunker. I saw Mrs. Suzuki and gave her a high five and then sat back to have some cereal while the others chased around a bunting. That old Attu air is just so memorable. We also saw two bald eagles fly as high as they could and then intertwine their grasps while freefalling together; releasing their grasp at the very last second. It was so beautiful it actually made me kind of miss Jess. Anyway, the flight was good, met this guy Brad and offered him some cookies but he only took 1.</p>
